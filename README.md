## Are ecological machine learning tools a relevant asset to population dynamic analysis?

#### Summary

This thesis project considers a state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) method for causal dependencies in timeseries analysis. Besides many other disciplines that already make use of such deep ML models, this field is less explored in ecology. Complex temporal (inter)dependencies between ecological relations (e.g. environment and species populations) can benefit greatly from these ML methods as many ecological questions are centred around understanding temporal dynamics by unravelling their underlying mechanisms. 

The use of machine learning (ML) models aid in understanding observed temporal ecological patterns. Due to the growing ecological datasets at our disposal, more and more opportunities arise to use ML models for analysis. Hence, it seems a promising tool to ecologists for accurate predictions. Nevertheless, it still remains unclear if these predictions are based on relevant ecological interactions (i.e. supported by ecological theory).

We will verify a ML approach and its ability to learn complex ecological relationships through evaluation of its performance in retrieving relationships from ecological datasets. This will be achieved by applying this method to a synthetic temporal ecological dataset with predefined relations, using a deterministic population model. Consequently, it is evaluated if the ML model is able to correctly retrieve the ecological relationships from this dataset.
