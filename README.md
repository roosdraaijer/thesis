## Are ecological machine learning tools a relevant asset to population dynamic analysis?

#### Summary

This project considers current methods in ecology that are used to analyse complex temporal (inter)dependencies between the environment and species populations. These population dynamics often arise from individual-level demographic processes, that can emerge in different population equilibria. Ecological questions are centred around understanding these temporal dynamics by unravelling their underlying mechanisms. 

The use of machine learning (ML) models aid in understanding observed temporal ecological patterns. Due to the growing ecological datasets at our disposal, more and more opportunities arise to use ML models for analysis. Hence, it seems a promising tool to population biologists for accurate predictions. Nevertheless, it still remains unclear if these predictions are based on relevant ecological interactions found on ecological theory.

We verify ML approaches and their ability to learn complex ecological relationships through evaluation of its performance in retrieving relationships from ecological datasets. This will be achieved by applying this method to a synthetic temporal ecological dataset with predefined relations, using a deterministic population model. Consequently, it is evaluated if the ML model is able to correctly retrieve the ecological relationships from this dataset.
